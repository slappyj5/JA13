-- I used an existing table of songs to learn new commands, including "AND" & "OR" to aggregate data to help figure out what songs would be the most epic and tolerable (not long!)
-- I also dug in a little deeper to figure out what songs to select at the end of the night that were epic, new, and most imporantly...not long!

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);

Select "title" from songs; 

SELECT "title" FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released > "1990";

Select "title" from songs where mood = "epic" AND released > 1990 AND duration < 240;
